# GH6-Proto-Patch
This patch does a couple small QoL fixes to the Guitar Hero 6 First Playable Prototype. These patches are
- Show the Music Test (MT) songs in the Song Select menu
- Show all venues in the Venue Select submenu
- Disable the Select "Viewer" debug menu
- Disable broken venues that crash the game (This seems to fix random crashes at startup)

## Installation
- Download the latest release
- Extract the contents to your game folder
- Run
- Select 'Unlock All' in the debug menu to see all venues.

## Notes
This mod is incapatible with saves from the base game. This is due to the venue additions.
> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid running the GH6 prototype on Xbox Live, This has a high risk of a console and even an account ban
